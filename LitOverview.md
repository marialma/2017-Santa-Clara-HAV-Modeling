# Notes on literature for reference

Currently (2017-09-18), there are ongoing HAV outbreaks in San Diego, Santa Cruz, and Michigan, affecting mostly IDU and homeless populations. This project is started out of the belief that modeling the transmission dynamics may yield insights into what might work to stop the outbreak.

[Most](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091589) [existing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26657185) [HAV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25764099) [modeling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21393559) papers have focused mostly on vaccinations and cost effectiveness in children. A quick search on pubmed did not return any papers looking at outbreaks, or transmission among adult populations. 

Given transmission dynamics and natural history of HAV, environmental models seem like they'd make sense. The following paper feels like it would be useful: [Brouwer et al: Dose-response relationships for environmentally mediated infectious disease transmission models](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005481). 

10/25/2017: After having had the chance to take a closer look at the data, I'm no longer sure environmental model is the best way to go. Perhaps a heterogenous SEIR model would be the best choice here. Luckily, this is probably much easier to do. 

## Hepatitis A Virus
* Non enveloped, single stranded RNA virus
* Low infectious dose - suspected anywhere from 10-100 particles. 
 
## Things to find

- [ ] Environmental persistence of HAV
  * [HAV survival in soil samples](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14619108)
  * [HAV in water](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10643389409388470?journalCode=best20)
- [ ] Infectious period
- [ ] Asymptomatics?
- [ ] Vaccine coverage/ effectiveness waning? 
- [ ] Time course of infection?
 * [Time course of viremia in blood](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14635005) 
 * More important to find viral load of stool?
- [ ] Genome-associated differences? 
 * Likely to be less relevant given everything in this outbreak is related, but could be interesting for future steps
 
## Other questions
* Can this relate to other ongoing outbreaks of HAV? (San Diego, Michigan) 
* Can this be used to predict what similar outbreaks (among homeless, drug user population) would look like in other cities (Berkeley, Oakland, SF?) 
  * If so, can we do a cost effectiveness analysis of doing HAV vaccination clinics NOW?
* How much of Santa Cruzs' outbreak is among MSM?
