# Notes on literature for reference

Currently (2017-09-18), there are ongoing HAV outbreaks in San Diego, Santa Cruz, and Michigan, affecting mostly IDU and homeless populations. This project is started out of the belief that modeling the transmission dynamics may yield insights into what might work to stop the outbreak.

[Most](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091589) [existing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26657185) [HAV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25764099) [modeling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21393559) papers have focused mostly on vaccinations and cost effectiveness in children. A quick search on pubmed did not return any papers looking at outbreaks, or transmission among adult populations. 

Given transmission dynamics and natural history of HAV, environmental models seem like they'd make the most sense. The following paper feels like it would be useful: [Brouwer et al: Dose-response relationships for environmentally mediated infectious disease transmission models](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005481)
