Modeling of the ongoing HAV outbreak in Santa Cruz. 

Please view [LitOverview.md](https://github.com/marialma/2017-Santa-Cruz-HAV-Modeling/blob/master/LitOverview.md) for now. 

Modeling this is on hold for now. I'm spending most of my time volunteering on the outbreak, so haven't had the time to sit down and really crank this out. I have gotten a really good chance to get into the data though, which has been incredibly helpful
